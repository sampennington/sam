# How I Led Localisation at VEED

When I was at **VEED**, leadership announced that we'd be **localising the entire platform** the following quarter. It was an exciting initiative — but also a chaotic one. There wasn't a clear plan, no one really owned it, and most teams already had jam-packed roadmaps.

Rather than let it fizzle out (and stress everyone out in the process), I decided to step up and bring some structure to it. I proposed that one of my teams lead the localisation effort — creating a clear point of contact, setting direction, and actually getting it shipped.

## The Challenges

This wasn’t a super-technical project — at least not at first glance.  
We just needed to serve a different set of copy depending on language, right?

The tricky parts turned out to be:
- **Communication** – The project touched 8+ codebases and 10+ teams. Everyone needed to stay in sync and keep their own roadmaps aligned.  
- **Maintaining translation quality** – Automated translations can get weird fast.  
- **Catching missing translations** – Avoiding the dreaded `{{hero.button.copy}}` showing up in production.  
- **Measuring impact** – Making sure all this effort actually moved the needle.

---

## Execution

We started from scratch: choosing tools, setting up infrastructure, and building the workflows.  
We landed on **Lokalise**, **i18next**, and a few **custom tools** we built along the way.

Everything was **feature-flagged**, since we couldn’t launch localisation half-done.  
Half the team went on a mission to extract and translate every bit of copy they could find (painfully manual work — if only we’d had Cursor back then 😅).  
The rest set up language detection, selectors, and tooling.

---

### Building the First Custom Tool

Pretty quickly, we hit our first big issue: **untranslated keys slipping through**.  
Occasionally, users would see things like `{{hero.button.copy}}` — not ideal.

We knew this would keep happening as more teams joined in, so we built our first internal tool:

**🛠️ Translation Validator GitHub Action**
- Validated that every key in our translation JSON files actually existed.  
- If a key was missing, the PR simply couldn’t be merged.  

This immediately stopped broken strings from hitting production. No more handlebars 🎉

We rolled out localisation **section by section**, handing off each area to its owning team for testing and feedback before moving on.

---

### Keeping Everyone Aligned

**Constant communication** was absolutely vital here:
- Regularly liaising with teams to decide which areas we’d tackle next.  
- Checking when they were free to test — translating a feature mid-refactor never ends well.  
- Sending **twice-weekly updates** to leadership to keep everyone aligned.

This was a real cross-team effort, and staying proactive with communication was the only reason it worked smoothly.

---

## Launch

We decided not to launch partially translated pages — seeing half-English, half-Spanish content just didn’t feel right.

Instead, we rolled out as an **A/B test**, starting small and gradually ramping up to a 50/50 split over a few days.  
Once we hit significance, the results were clear.

---

## Results 🚀

The results were huge — **8–18% uplift in exports and revenue** across our core language markets (Spanish, French, and a few others).

On top of that, we:
- Removed thousands of hard-coded strings.  
- Improved collaboration across engineering and design.  
- Set VEED up to expand internationally with confidence.

---

## What Came Next

Of course, new problems popped up once localisation was live:
- Developers were slowed down needing translations for every PR.  
- Sometimes they’d forget, leaving bits of English copy on translated pages.  
- Lokalise was pay-per-seat, and we definitely didn’t want to buy 60+ dev accounts.

So… we built our **second custom tool**.

**🤖 Auto-Translation PR Bot**
- Listened for copy changes via GitHub webhooks.  
- Triggered a Cloud Function to request translations from Lokalise.  
- Automatically opened a PR with the translated copy.

No more manual steps — devs didn’t have to log into Lokalise, request translations, or merge anything. It all just happened.

Developer experience went way up. 🚀

## Final Thoughts

This wasn’t the hardest project technically, but it was one of the most cross-functional and communication-heavy ones I’ve led.

Localisation taught me that success in engineering isn’t just about the code — it’s about **ownership, clarity, and relentless communication**.  

And yeah, we might’ve accidentally shipped a few `hero.copy` keys along the way… but that’s half the fun.

When I was at **VEED**, leadership announced that we’d be **localising the entire platform** the following quarter. It was an exciting initiative, but also a chaotic one. There wasn’t a clear plan, no one really owned it, and most teams were already stretched thin with jam packed roadmaps.

The Challenges

This wasn't a super technically complicated project, we just need to serve a different set of copy depending on language, right?

The hard parts here were going to be:
- Communication. This was a project that affected 8+ codebases, 10+ teams, everyone needed to be up to date and have their own roadmaps aligned. 
- Maintaining good-enough translations
- Not missing translations
- Measuring impact


## Execution

We started from scratch, what tools to use: We opted for Lokalise, i18next, and some custom tools we built (more on them later!).
We knew we couldn't release localisation unless it was complete, so feature flagged it in every codebase.
Half the team then went ahead and started translating everything they could find. This was very manual, boring work. I only we waited a few months and cursor etc came about :facepalm:
The rest went on to setup all our tooling, detecting language, language selectors and the like. 


The first custom tool we needed:

First issue we encountered, we were occasionaly letting untranslated keys get in, which meant we'd serve the dreaded `{{hero.button.copy}}` etc. With so many engineers that were going to need to do this, we knew it'd keep happening, so we made our first custom tool:
- Translation validator Github Action - Which validated the keys in our JSON files of translations all existed. No translation? Coudln't be meeged. We immediatley stopped seeing issues like this, no more handlebars :tada: 


We did this area by area, when one section was done we'd hand it off to the team for them to test as well, and raise any issues early. 


** Constant Communication ** was really vital to success here. 
- Liasing with other teams constantly -  which areas we were tackling next? When were they free to test? What's their roadmap? Translating a feature while they were updating it would be akward so we avoided it as much as we could. 
- Twice-weekly updates on progress. Keeping stakeholders in the loop


## Launch

It was deemed not possible to launch part of the site first, seing part in english and part in spanish would be a bit crap... and we wanted to tread carefully, this was a big change!

So we rolled out as an AB test to a small percentage of users to get data back. Over the coruse of a few days we reached a 50/50 split and quickly reached significance in most languages. 



##  Result
Resutls were pretty huge, 8-18% uplift in exports/revenue across our core language markets :rocket: 



##  What happens next?
A few issues start to arise we need solutions for:
- Developers are being slowed down, needing to get translations on every copy touching PR. 
- Sometimes forgetting to get translations, meaning we serve english copy to a translated page. 
- We have a pay per seat plan with Lokalise, we don't want to get 60 devs seats to this


So we needed a way to automate this. I built the second custom tool we needed here. It would:
- Listen for any changes in copy and automatically create a pull request with the required translations. I did this in a cloud function Leveraging Lokalise + Github webhooks and API's.
This made developer experience a lot better, there was no remembering to log in to lokalise, requesting transaltions, creating a PR, merging it in. Everything was just done.
